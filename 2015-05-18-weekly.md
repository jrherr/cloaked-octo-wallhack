## Monday, May 18th, 2015

9 am to Noon - went over files from the weekend, responded to a couple of weekend question emails.

re-evaluationed raw read mapping from metagenome assembly using bwa mem consider swapping `bwa mem -t 4 -B 40 -O 60 -E 10` for `bwa mem -t 4 -T 30` in previous runs -- looks to be more strict.  Trying not to have any co-assembly issues.

wrote program for 100 blast reiterations to check on which criterion works best for mapping the raw reads back to the metagenome assembly.
