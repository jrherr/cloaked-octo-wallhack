# Monday, May 18th, 2015
9 am to Noon - went over files from the weekend, responded to a couple of weekend question emails.

re-evaluationed raw read mapping from metagenome assembly using bwa mem consider swapping `bwa mem -t 4 -B 40 -O 60 -E 10` for `bwa mem -t 4 -T 30` in previous runs -- looks to be more strict.  Trying not to have any co-assembly issues.

afternoon - wrote program for 100 blast reiterations to check on which criterion works best for mapping the raw reads back to the metagenome assembly.

# Tuesday, May 19th, 2015
9 am - Took short queue from the previous night and used the output from pyfasta to separate groups in the blast sections of equal size to be re-joined later.  

Queued up 100 24-hour runs on the HPCC to blast non-redundant assembly contigs and bin into groups for metagenome

Noon to 2 pm - ate lunch and met with Paul and helped him map his functional data to the 16S using R, PAUP, and python.  Jackson sat in on the meeting also.

2 pm - 3 pm ran command line update with updated Xcode version

3 pm - wrote one liner script for read map quality and read abundances in metagenome assembly from BAM files

4 pm - wrote email to AWS guy to check in on the EDAMAME credits for the students, saved a copy of the newest ami and replaced the older ami version on AWS.

# Wednesday, May 20th, 2015

9 am - Noon - Checked in on 100 blast runs that are running on HPCC - fastest took 13 hours, longest took 21 hours -- curious to see how long all 100 will take.  I then spent the morning organizing tutorials for EDAMAME.  Fixing issues with tutorials that Jackson went through and updating some of Siobhan's work.  I then totally refreshed the shell tutorial -- still a WIP.

3 pm - fielded questions from Greg and two post-docs
  
# Thursday, May 21th, 2015

9:30 am to 11:30 am - Sang-Hoon came to office to ask me to fix hdf5 error on QIIME - updated the ShadeLab QIIME instance to have [updated hdf5 fix](https://github.com/biocore/qiime/pull/1741) from QIIME.  Should be working fine now, ran a few quick tests, but problem occurs during the writing to BIOM file stage which is at the end of Sang-Hoon's analysis (approximately 24 hours in).  Sang-Hoon is re-running the analysis.

11:30 - ate lunch earlier than usual - hungry!

12:00 noon - worked on EDAMAME tutorials

1:00 pm - 2:00 pm - worked with John C. to go over a list of taxa he can slim down for his microcosm experiments.  I provided him a list of functional annotations for the first round of the assembly (think he might have had this already) and we went over the list of relevant taxa in the Centralia metagenome assembly and amplicon annotation.

2:00 pm - worked on a way to "speed" up the process on HPCC -- not trying to break code, need more jobs to finish.

4:00 pm - responded to emails for the first time today.


# Friday, May 22nd, 2015

6 am - got up and worked on manuscript.

9 am - 

# Weekend
