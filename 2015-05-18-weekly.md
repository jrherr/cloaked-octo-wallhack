# Monday, May 18th, 2015
9 am to Noon - went over files from the weekend, responded to a couple of weekend question emails.

re-evaluationed raw read mapping from metagenome assembly using bwa mem consider swapping `bwa mem -t 4 -B 40 -O 60 -E 10` for `bwa mem -t 4 -T 30` in previous runs -- looks to be more strict.  Trying not to have any co-assembly issues.

afternoon - wrote program for 100 blast reiterations to check on which criterion works best for mapping the raw reads back to the metagenome assembly.

9 am - Took short queue from the previous night and used the output from pyfasta to separate groups in the blast sections of equal size to be re-joined later.  

Queued up 100 24-hour runs on the HPCC to blast non-redundant assembly contigs and bin into groups for metagenome

Noon to 2 pm - ate lunch and met with Paul and helped him map his functional data to the 16S using R, PAUP, and python.  Jackson sat in on the meeting also.

2 pm - 3 pm ran command line update with updated Xcode version

3 pm - wrote one liner script for read map quality and read abundances in metagenome assembly from BAM files

4 pm - wrote email to AWS guy to check in on the EDAMAME credits for the students, saved a copy of the newest ami and replaced the older ami version on AWS.

9 am - Noon - Checked in on 100 blast runs that are running on HPCC - fastest took 13 hours, longest took 21 hours -- curious to see how long all 100 will take.  I then spent the morning organizing tutorials for EDAMAME.  Fixing issues with tutorials that Jackson went through and updating some of Siobhan's work.  I then totally refreshed the shell tutorial -- still a WIP.
