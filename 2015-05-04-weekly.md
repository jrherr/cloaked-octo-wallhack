# status update

10 am - mapped strain diversity from metagenome assembly and looked at potential candidates for assembly based on low strain diversity or possible complete or near-complete single strains.

### Candidate genera for single strain assemblies for Centralia metagenome

Blochmannia
Caldicellulosiruptor
Calditerrivibrio
Calothrix
Crinalium
Cronobacter
Dichelobacter
Emticicia
Geitlerinema
Halogeometricum
Kinetoplastibacterium
Lawsonia
Leadbetterella
Marivirga
Metallosphaera
Methanocella
Methanomethylovorans
Methylovorus
Microcoleus
Natrinema
Oceanithermus
Oscillatoria
Paludibacter
Pelotomaculum
Prochlorococcus
Rhodopirellula
Riemerella
Singulisphaera
Stanieria
Stenotrophomonas
Sulfolobus
Sulfuricurvum
Thermoplasma
Thermoplasmatales
Thioflavicoccus

TODO: double check on strains -- some strains from Sang-Hoon's recommendation, not many Firmucutes, maybe due to strain diversity and depth of sequencing.

## notes

9 am - Noon - metagenome assembly parsing of Centralia datasets -
  worked on assemblies for Thiofalvicoccus, Natrinema, Crinalium

11 am - 2 pm worked on metagenome assemblies, but while waiting for test scripts to run, also used time to clean and organize HPCC file folders which were unorganized.

2 pm - went over Sang-Hoon's poster and provided first pass of comments

3 pm - John Ionnadis talk

4 pm - 5:30 pm addressed EDAMAME data set question from Natalie/Greg, email

## notes

9 am - 9:30 am went over Sang-Hoon's poster for another round, post other comments

10 am - 2 pm  archived old files from HPCC to make room for SAM and BAM files from Centralia metagenome

11 am - 1 pm  organized notes folder & ate lunch

1 pm - worked on metagenome assembly, bam & sam file inspection, fastq output

2:30 pm - went over mock community pcr script with Sang-Hoon, got feedback on 16S diversity

3:15 pm - 4 pm - phone call with John Carlson (PhD advisor) about future plans and working with aggressive collaborator

5 pm - meeting with Greg
