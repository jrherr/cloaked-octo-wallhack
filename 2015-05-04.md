# status update

10 am - mapped strain diversity from metagenome assembly and looked at potential candidates for assembly based on low strain diversity or possible complete or near-complete single strains.

### Candidate genera for single strain assemblies for Centralia metagenome

Blochmannia
Caldicellulosiruptor
Calditerrivibrio
Calothrix
Crinalium
Cronobacter
Dichelobacter
Emticicia
Geitlerinema
Halogeometricum
Kinetoplastibacterium
Lawsonia
Leadbetterella
Marivirga
Metallosphaera
Methanocella
Methanomethylovorans
Methylovorus
Microcoleus
Natrinema
Oceanithermus
Oscillatoria
Paludibacter
Pelotomaculum
Prochlorococcus
Rhodopirellula
Riemerella
Singulisphaera
Stanieria
Stenotrophomonas
Sulfolobus
Sulfuricurvum
Thermoplasma
Thermoplasmatales
Thioflavicoccus

TODO: double check on strains -- some strains from Sang-Hoon's recommendation, not many Firmucutes, maybe due to strain diversity and depth of sequencing.
