## Monday, May 11th, 2015

9 am to 10 am - started on weekly log, answered a couple of weekend emails, checked on scripts running on the HPCC over the weekend

10 am to 11 am - worked on going over the output of assembly scripts for the weekend.  

  Note: still need to come up with a good assessment of how specific the mapping assessment needs to be to pull the "correct" amount of raw reads.

11 am to Noon - met with graduate student who contacted me regarding an issue with QIIME and PICRUSt output on the HPCC.  Initial contact message forwarded to me from the HPCC.
