## Monday, May 11th, 2015

9 am to 10 am - started on weekly log, answered a couple of weekend emails, checked on scripts running on the HPCC over the weekend

10 am to 11 am - worked on going over the output of assembly scripts for the weekend.  

  Note: still need to come up with a good assessment of how specific the mapping assessment needs to be to pull the "correct" amount of raw reads.

11 am to 12:30 - met with student at BEACON who contacted me regarding an issue with QIIME and PICRUSt output on the HPCC.  Initial contact message forwarded to me from the HPCC.

12:30 pm to 1:30 pm - Lunch and emails

1:30 pm to 3:00 pm - genome assembly parsing

3:00 pm to 3:30 pm - left the office to head home to avoid tornado and thunderstorm

3:30 pm to 6:30 pm - worked on more genome assembly parsing, then answered emails

## Tuesday, May 12th, 2015

6 am to 8 am - worked on an old manuscript that I am getting pressure to finish

9:00 am to 10:00 am - at office, answered email and transferred data from HPCC to computer

10:00 am to 12:30 pm - worked alongside Jackson on the EDAMAME tutorials, AWS ami editing, and timing how long it takes to transfer data from HPCC to AWS for tutorial timing.

12:30 ish - FIRE DRILL - got kicked out of building and got an ice cream with Jackson, Kiera, and Taylor.

1:00 pm - 5 pm worked on EDAMAME tutorials, editing text file, updated scripts folder, and worked on EDAMAME tutorials some more.

## Wednesday, May 13th, 2015

6 am to 8 am - worked on an old manuscript that I am getting pressure to finish

9 am to 9:30 am - responded to morning email and organized files from nightly runs

9:30 am to 10:30 - worked with Jackson on tutorials, updated refreshed tutorial for me

10:30 to 12:30 - Beth Norman (from Ned's Lab) stopped by office for 16S analysis help - moved data to HPCC, ran pandaseq on 196 samples, and pushed in the direction of QIIME.  Tried to convince her to wait for EDAMAME, but poster needs to be finished this week.

12:30 lunch, email, and updated this file

1:00 to 3:30 - worked on tutorials, metagenome assembly, was availble to Jackson, who is running through and testing tutorials

3:30 to 5 pm - worked on R script, talked to Ann from Channel 10 news about interview, worked on R script, and then had to fill out the RVSM Policy Training form from the MMG office.

## Thursday, May 14th, 2015

9 am to 11 am - answered morning emails, worked on genome parsing of the metagenome assembly, and then helped point Paul in the right direction regarding mapping his functional annotation to KEGG map in R.  I told him to try it out and we'll schedule an update meeting next week to see how he faired without me.

12 pm - worked on tutorial alongside Jackson for a while

2 pm - metagenome assembly 

3 pm - went over Sang-Hoon's poster for ASM and sent my changes to him

## Friday, May 15th, 2015

9 am - shut down computer before building power outage.

9:30 am - went to library and worked on HPCC inspecting output of scripts, re-queued 36 scripts to run over weekend.

11:30 am 12:30 pm - headed back to office and had lunch and checked/answered emails

12:30 pm - looked at k-mer spectra of metagenome assemblies, data in text format, need to graph spectra for output figure, downloaded model fitting documentation from R for specificity of radfit

4:00 pm - met Greg and went to microbial ecology coffee hour

## Weekend

ran and re-ran a bunch of scripts for the metagenome assembly.  Going to analyze script output this week for final assembly.  Did a bunch of other stuff...
